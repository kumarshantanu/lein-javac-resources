# lein-javac-resources

Leiningen plugin to work with resource files in `:java-source-paths`.

This plugin is meant to be used on projects with legacy Java code bases where
resource files are placed with Java source files.

## Usage

Include the plugin in the `:plugins` vector in `project.clj`:

```clojure
:plugins [[lein-javac-resources "0.1.0"]]
:omit-source true  # avoids .java files ending up in the generated JAR file
:hooks [leiningen.javac-resources]
```
